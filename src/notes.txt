interesting methods for the ncurses lib:
open, close and refresh always.
raw()
keypad() maybe
move()
addch()
mvaddch() combination of the previous two, a little difficult to implement for text editor because of UX
getmaxyx()
getch() input 
my_win = create_newwin(height, width, starty, startx); need to create method, not preinstalled and also one to destroy the window when done
while((ch = getch()) != KEY_F(1))
scr_dump();
curs_set();


NOTES!!!:
most functions take in the y-x coordinates, not x-y
